In this project there will be different versions.
You can download this project and use it or edit it if it will be uploaded in this repository as pull request.

At this moment (9-1-2021) i'm working on an optimised version. After that I will work in versions with css styles and more options.

I woulld like you to create new tools on the app as circles or arcs.
